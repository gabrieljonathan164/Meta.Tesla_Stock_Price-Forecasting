# META and TSLA Stock Price Forecasting Model (LSTM)

This research uses an LSTM neural network model to forecast future stock prices. Historical closing prices are utilized to train the model to comprehend time series patterns and seasonality.

Data preparation, model definition and training, evaluation, and final predictions are all covered in the notebook. RMSE, MAE, and R2 scores are among the performance indicators computed.

- The result is a CSV file containing the original test set prices as well as the forecasted values for those time steps for both META and TSLA.
- Preprocessed time series datasets, engineered features capturing temporal dependencies, compared loss functions and analyzed model performance.
- Integrated LSTM predictions into valuation-at-risk simulations to enable better-informed data-driven investment decisions, reaffirming deep learning's value for quant finance.
